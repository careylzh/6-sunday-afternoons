# Arduino Automated Ultrasonic Ball Balancer
6-sunday-afternoons, corrugated board, recycled blue foam, safety pins, paper faster, arduino UNO R3, duct tape. Difficulty was in optimising the physical setup and calibrating the motor.

PID code modified on our system is by: https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=361457.0

Did not use PID concept in the end.
